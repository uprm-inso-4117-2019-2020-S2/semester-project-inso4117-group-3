# _*_CESCO_ Express*_

_**I. Domain Description:**_

_CESCO_ or “Centro de Servicios al Conductor” is the local Department of Motorized Vehicles for Puerto Rico. It provides services to customers regarding the management, registration, and provision of licenses. The Department consists of staff including general management, workstation employees, vehicle inspectors, etc. Customers can come in and receive their turn on-site, or they can use the online platform to obtain their turn beforehand. The location has several sites for different functions, a section where the workstation employees can attend customers, which can, in turn, work different documentation, such as license permits or vehicle registration. There’s also an area where staff can meet and discuss matters regarding work. Another space is the registry where paper documents not yet converted to digital are.

_**II. Stakeholdes:**_

+ _CESCO_ employees (users)
+ The government of Puerto Rico (owners/clients)
+ Software Engineering: Testing’s group 3 current team members
+ The receiver of the _CESCO_’s services (customers)

_**III. Current Situation:**_

Most customers have to wait long lines to get attended and then for the process of the service they come to. This situation is aggravated by the huge amounts of customers that need _CESCO_’s services and the constant crashes the actual system suffers. Also, a fault of organization in the whole process where documents needed are not clear, leads to a very unpleasant experience for anyone.

_**IV. Needs:**_

There is a need to speed up and streamline the processes done at the _CESCO_.

_**V. Ideas:**_

Then the idea is to develop a new system that solves these issues.

Some of the features that this new system will have are:
    
+ An interface that will allow the customer to select a system presets, depending on the work position. Several document presets will be available for customer services, that when saved get sent into a database. 
+ Terminals will also be developed so that simple services such as bill payments may be made without the need to have an employee attend customers, slowing down services.
+ The system will allow users to edit and update customer's data within the system. 
+ The system will withstand high user traffic so that multiple users can properly work with it. 
+ It will only be accessible from within the designated terminals, to prevent external tampering and protect its database. 
+ For further performance improvement, several levels of clearance will also be implemented to allow certain employees to oversee the system's functions and performance.

_**VI. Concepts:**_

+ Forms
+ Signatures
+ Stamps
+ Images
+ Social Security Card
+ Drivers License
+ Service Terminals

_**VII. Scope:**_

The scope of _CESCO_ Express is to provide a platform that offers current services in a more efficient way. 

_**VIII. Span:**_

We want a system that performs better efficiency when being attended, so the clients spend less time in the _CESCO_ lines waiting for service. Also offering all the services from only one site it would keep information more organized and easy to find for the customers. 


_**IX. Requirements:**_

- As a customer I want a system that can speed up the process so that I can have more free time to do other diligences. 
- As a worker I would like a system that would help us decrease the waiting line and do a more efficient job.
- As a customer I would like the system to help me if I don’t have some of the necessary documents on me.
- As a customer I want to do some diligence like paying tickets, stamps and car tags online, or do some of the processes online. Just so I could finish it in their offices. 

_**X. Assumptions and Dependancies:**_

For the development of _CESCO_ Express, we assume that developers and supervisors would approve and accept the document for the project. Developers working on the project will have access to the knowledge from the domain so they could work with, the tools that are used are going to be easy and accessible so that when the project rotates new developers don’t have difficulty using it and can catch up easily to keep with the project. The project will end up helping to speed the process in _CESCO_ offices, give a better service and help the people that have some problems with their documents or their trip to the offices. 

_**XI. Goals:**_

+ Faster attendance
+ Better, more reliable, streamlined system
+ Easy access and retrieval of the needed documents, or official information needed by the attendee/customer.
